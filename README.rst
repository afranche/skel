Skel is an abstraction layer to asynchronous libraries such as trio_ or asyncio_ and a full-featured web framework
built on top of this abstraction layer.

Why ?
_____

The goal of Skel is to abstract away asynchronous logic behind common flows and build a web framework on top of this
abstraction. I found async web frameworks to be nice to work with in general but I wanted to experiment a more featured
and easy-going framework to make things composable, simple and with a gentle learning curve.

Current Status
______________

The project is still being properly specced on its way to a 0.1.0 specification. Hopefully a backlog_ is in place and
allows you to follow my progress so far.
