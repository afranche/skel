Skel
====

Skel is an abstraction layer to asynchronous libraries and a web framework built using it.

The goal of Skel is to abstract away asynchronous logic behind common flows and build a web framework on top of this
abstraction. I found async web frameworks to be nice to work with in general but I wanted to experiment a featured
and easy-going framework to make things composable and simple.
